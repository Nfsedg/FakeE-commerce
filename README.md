# Fake e-commerce

The proyect was builded with React Js with Create-React-App and Fake Store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/) and deployed with Vercel https://fake-e-commerce-4ufa4kv4z-nfsedg.vercel.app/

## Technologies

For this proyect I used react-router for routing pages for each category and article. 
implementing CSS Modules for each component and axios for fetching data of API

## issues

Due the store API doesn't have an option to store new data, like new users or new products or modify the existing data, I use the login for the application an existing user on the API.

You can use the following information for login:
Username: johnd
Password: m38rmF$
